	<!-- Parapgraph -->
	<p>I recently just transferred up to <b>The University of Maine</b> from a community college back in Massachusetts. After high school I was not too sure of what I wanted to do. I was originally planning to go to Parsons in New York for fashion design and photography but I've always had a passion for owning my own business one day, and not working for anyone else except me.</p>

	<!-- Paragraph -->
	<p> Going to a community college gave me more time to think about what I wanted to do when I was older. If I had not gone I beleive I would've been in New York right now at Parsons instead of here at UMaine. Since graduating high school and starting community college in 2017 I have ventured into building multiple 6 figure ecommerce business along with doing digital marketing for my businesses.
