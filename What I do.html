<!-- Ecommerce Paragraph -->

<p> Shortly afrer highschool I was looking for more ways to expand my income. One day I came across this thing called Shopify and Ecommerce. Since then I have used Shopify to build multiple six figure online businesses and use this as a main stream income for myself. </p>



<p> As for digital marketing I use Facebook and google to advertise for my businesses. Mostly using Facebook however. After a year of wasting a lot of money on facebook I was able to finanally crack the code of how to use Facebook successfully to market for my businesses and some of my clients that I help out with their marketing and business direction. Although I consider myself okay at what I do I am always looking to learn more about online marketing so I can expand sales even more and hit my goals of making 500K revenue in one month and eventually 1 million in revenue in one month by the end of 2019. Below is a screenshot of my sales from one store that I own from January 1st 2019 until Febuary 20th 2019.</p>

<p> Sine 7th grade I have always been interested in graphic design. I started doing graphic design and logos for my ecommerce brands but eventually outsourced and now I have a team for that and also a web developer.
